pos,NetworkingDevices,Cheap and best WiFi 5 gigabit router. One of the cheapest WiFi 5 gigabit routers. Those not willing to pay 4k rupees or more for WiFi 6 & 6E routers will find this one to be suitable enough. Keep in mind that WiFi 6 & 6E routers will of course have better performance and stability than WiFi 5 routers.Can easily stream 4k videos and download files. No issues on video calls either on phone or PC. No connection drops or any other problems so far.I had to input my ISP-provided account username and password during setup on the miwifi website. Not sure if that will be the case for everybody.Will update in a few more months.,B09MKG4ZCM,4.0,Home & Office,-0.995953202,19/04/22

pos,Mobiles&Accessories,Above average phone. I purchased the 6/128gb variant.To sum  it up in to pros and cons.Pros :-1.Good design in terms of look of the phone and it's build quality.2. Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.Cons :-1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera  is inferior to stock selfie photo.2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery.,B07WDK3ZS6,4.1,Home & Office,-0.961957633,20/05/22

pos,GeneralPurposeBatteries&BatteryChargers,Perfect replacement cell for trimmer. Bought it to replace my Phillips QT4005 trimmer's 7yr old  battery cell.Old trimmer battery lost it torque... would not start without smacking it on the hand.Soldering the connections was bit tricky but i got it done by sanding both side surfaces of the new battery cell.New Duracell one does its job..trimmer works now like its supposed to.Its lasts more than 30+ minutes easily.Charges like its supposed to.I am satisfied with it. Saved an electronic device from being obsolete.If you want more performance..maybe get 900mah cell....but for me thats expensive...750mah is enough.Long term performance is to be seen.,B003B00484,4.3,Home & Office,-0.997677624,09/04/22
